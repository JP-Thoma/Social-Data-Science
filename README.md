# Social-Data-Science
A repository that addresses the combination of Data Science and International Relations. Group D rocks!!

I pursue having a positive and meaningful impact in the world with my work, knowledge and personality. Hence, I see it as my mission to ensure constant improvement to be well-prepared for complicated challenges in the world of digital consultancy. My aspiration includes perfecting the combination of thematic knowledge from social sciences, especially international relations and economics, with technical skills of the data science field, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, to facilitate innovation and to provide better consultancy in politics and business related topics. Currently, I aim at helping to defeat digital risk for organisations with Constella Intelligence, further deepening my technical skills by graduating successfully from IE Business School, and supporting the NGO AEGEE-Madrid during its digital transformation process.

During my free time you will see me running around on tennis courts, practising my music instruments, trying out new bread loaf baking recipes or making handcrafted wine.
